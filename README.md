# Across The Obelisk - MoreTranslations Mod

With this mod you can easily create custom translations for the game without having to edit the game files.

**How to install?**

This mod requires the [BepInEx AcrossTheObelisk](https://across-the-obelisk.thunderstore.io/package/BepInEx/BepInExPack_AcrossTheObelisk/) plugin.

* Install from [Thunderstore](https://across-the-obelisk.thunderstore.io/) Mod Manager

    or

* Download the folder **MoreTranslations_DontTouchFranky** from this repository and place it in the **BepInEx/plugins** folder.

> **Note:** If you install this mod with r2modman, the 'translations' folder may be deleted and every file inside it will be moved in the main folder. The mod will still work and you can create new translations directly in the main folder just by adding .txt files with the name of the language you want to translate.


**How to use?**

* To change the language, go to the game settings (you'll see a new language dropdown) and select the desired language.

**How to create a new translation?**

1. Create a new folder that has the name of the language to be translated.
    es: `english` for English

2. Copy all the .txt translation files from the game folder to the new folder.

3. Edit the file names to match the language you want to translate. 
    es: `english.txt` for English Default File, `english_cards.txt` for English Cards File

4. Edit the files with the desired translations.

> **Note:** The files must be in the same format as the original files.
>
> **Leave the tags as they are, do not change them.**
>
> **Do not change the structure and do not rename the folders inside the plugin.**



**How to contribute?**

If you want to contribute to the project, you can do it by translating the game into your language or by correcting the translations of the existing languages.
